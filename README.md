# Evolution Simulation

## Introduction

In this project, we aim to simulate an ecosystem consisting of plants and animals. The ecosystem is modeled using object-oriented programming principles in Java. The simulation has several features, including the ability for organisms to move, eat, mate, and give birth to offspring. We also implement a neural network to model animal behavior and decision making.

## Technologies

The following technologies are used in this project:

- Java

## Features

List of features that are implemented in the simulation. For example:

- Animals can move and search for food and mates.
- Plants grow and reproduce.
- Animals have neural networks that influence their behavior.
- Sexual and asexual reproduction.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to the simulation program, feel free to fork the repository and make changes as you see fit. 
You can then submit a pull request with your changes for review.

## Authors

This program was created by Jeremy Moser, based on ideas of the coding training, the bibites and many more.
